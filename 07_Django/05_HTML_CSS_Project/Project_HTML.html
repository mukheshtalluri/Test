<p id="Django"> Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern and promotes the use of reusable code and a clean design. Django comes with a wide range of built-in features like an admin panel, authentication system, and ORM, which helps developers build web applications quickly without reinventing the wheel. Its strong community support and scalability make it a popular choice for both small and large-scale projects. </p>

<p id="Flask"> Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that is designed to be simple and easy to get started with. It follows a minimalistic approach, giving developers the freedom to choose their tools and libraries. Flask is based on the WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine, making it ideal for building small to medium-sized web applications. Despite its simplicity, Flask is highly extensible and can be scaled up with various extensions for database integration, authentication, and more. Its straightforward design makes it a popular choice for developers who prefer more control over their application structure. </p>

<p id="Fastapi"> FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be fast, easy to use, and production-ready, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs and microservices. FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc, and offers built-in support for data validation, serialization, and asynchronous programming. Its strong typing and auto-completion features improve developer productivity and reduce bugs, making FastAPI a top choice for modern backend development. </p>
