What programing language:
    Programming language is used to interact with the computers. Computers are dumb machines based on instructions only
    it will perform the tasks. Computers understand only machine language which is very difficult to understand we need to
    translater to communicate between humans and machine. Programing languages will play role of translators.

Low level vs High level:
    Low level languages consist of only zeros and ones very difficult to understand.
        Ex: Machine language, Assembly languages

    High level languages consist of human-readable code by using those languages we can perform our activities.
        Ex: Complied languages, Interpreter languages

Compiled languages vs Interpreter languages:
    Compiled language which convert source code file into byte code file and will execute and compilation process will be done at a time.
        Ex: C, C++
    Interpreted language which won't generate any additional file execution done line by line.
        Ex: JavaScript, PHP

Python:
    Python is a high level and general purpose programing language. Which is easy to use and dynamically typed.
    Python is a scripting language. Normally scripting languages are used for specific purpose but python is general purpose language.
    Python is used various fields such as web development, game development, desktop application development, machine learning, data science..etc
    Python is a Hybrid language. Source code -> Python compiler -> Intermediate code -> PVM(Runtime Environment) -> Machine code.

Python paradigms:
    When we are developing complex pieces of software we need to follow the set of guidelines to get better software for creation maintain.
    -> Functional programing
    -> Procedural programing
    -> Modular programing
    -> Object oriented programing
