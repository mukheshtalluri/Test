- IP :
    IP address is a unique address that identifies device on the internet or local network. IP stand for Internet Protocol.
    IP governs the kind of data which over sent over the internet or local network.IP address is an identifier that allow
    information sent between devices. They contain location information and makes devices accessible for the communication.
    Version :
        - IPv4
        - IPv6
    Types of IP:
        - Public IP : A public IP address is the address where one primary address is associated with the whole network.
            Eg : IP address provided to the router by the ISP.
        - Private IP : A unique IP number generated to the every device which are connect to the internet.
            Eg : IP address generated by the router to all connected devices.
        - Static IP : A static IP address does not change and it is manually created. These IP address is more expensive and more reliable.
            Eg : Server hosting
        - Dynamic IP : A IP address which change time to time. and it was generated by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
            Eg : Consumer equipment

- OSI Model :
    The OSI(Open System Interconnection) model is the logical and conceptual model that defines network communication
    used by the systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems.The OSI model defines logical network
    and effectively describe computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.

    The OSI model seen as the universal language for computer networking it is based on the concept of splitting
    communication system into seven abstract layers.each one stacked upon the last.

    - Why OSI model matter:
        The OSI model has defined common terminology used in networking discussions and documentation.They allow us to take
        very complex communication apart and evaluate its components.
        - Make troubleshooting easier and help to identify threats across the entire stack.
        - Encourage hardware manufactures to create networking products that can communicate with each other over network.
        - Essential for developing security first mindset.
        - Separate complex function into the simpler components.
    - 7 Layers of the OSI model.
        - Application layer : Application layer responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that relies on software to present to meaningful data.
        - Presentation / Translation Layer : The data extracted from the application layer and manipulate the data to required format
             and transmit over the network. Presentation layer responsible for Translation, encryption/decryption and compressed.
        - Session : This layer is responsible for the open / close communication between the two devices. This layer also synchronous data transfer
        - Transport layer : This layer is responsible for the end to end connection between the two devices. This include taking
            data from the session and breaking into small chunk called segments before sending data into the network layer.
        - Network layer : Network layer is responsible for the data transfer between the two different networks.The network layer
            break up into small segments from transport layer into small segments called packets.The network layer find best path for the data
            to reach destination called routing. The two devices communicated on same network network layer is not need.
        - Data link : Data link layer same as the network layer and it facilitate the data transfer between two devices on the same network.
        - Physical layer : it include data transfer devices like cables etc.

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
    - TCP is an connection oriented, meaning once connection has been established data can be transfer in the both the directions.
      TCP has in built system to check for errors and grantee the data delivery order which it was sent. Perfect protocol
      for the transfer still images, data files, webpages..etc
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
    - UDP is an connection less internet protocol in which error checking and data recover not required.Data is continuously sent
      irrespective of receiver received or not.

- DNS (Domain name system):
    - DNS used to convert human readable domain names to IP address. Eg : google.com , IP : 122.250.192.232
    - DNS involving following this steps :
    1. Client types 'example.com' into a web browser, The query travels through the internet and received by the DNS resolver.
    2. The resolver then recursively queries a DNS root nameserver.
    3. The root server responds to the resolver with the address of a Top-Level Domain (TLD).
    4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.
    5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain's nameserver, example.com.
    6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain's nameserver.
    7. The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.
    8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.

        DNS Recursive Resolver --> DNS Root name Server --> TLD name server --> Authoritative root server

    Server types:
    - DNS Resolver : DNS recursive resolver act as the middle man between Client and DNS name server. Once query received
      from the client recursive resolver responds with cached data and send request to the root name server.followed by
      another request to the TLD name server and followed by Authoritative root server and get get responce io address.

    - DNS root server : A root server accept recursive resolver query includes a domain name, and root name server responds
      by directing recursive resolver to TLD name server based on the extension of the domain.

    - TLD (Top level domain) name server : TLD name server consisting of all domain data consist of all extensions.

    - Authoritative root server : This last step in the DNS server it corresponds to the specified IP address.

   Eg : Route53, CloudfLare DNS, Google cloud DNS, Azure DNS, NS1
